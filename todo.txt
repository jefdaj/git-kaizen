investigate alternative technologies:
  check that ansible playbooks don't basically do what you want before continuing
  consider cue as a task description language
  consider dhall as a task description language
  consider jsonnet as a task description language

start writing docs in haddock:
  read https://mmhaskell.com/blog/comments-in-haskell
  read https://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/markup.html

logging:
  consider katip
  but default to using the same style as ortholang unless there's a good case for something else

start config + docopt + logging based on Ortholang:
  Types.Config type
  loadConfig used in main
  Ortholang.Interpreter.Config ... how much of that would I need? seems very verbose now

Tasks:
  model them on ortholang Modules for now
  start with a data type
  add longer definitions below as needed
  factor out library functions

hot reloading:
  see how hard it would be to do something like in gitit
  compiling each time wouldn't be so bad to start if necessary
